There files contain my Twillio API account credentials.

Andres Renaud, your GitHub profile has a repository with OUR Twilio account TOKEN. 

PLEASE REMOVE THE REPOSITORY ASAP. 

Someone hacked our Twilio account because they were able to collect the token from your Git.

Let me know when you completely remove it. 

Thanks,Â
